# TestiPy - Mocking utils for pytest.
mock requests and database calls. 

# requests
Requests mocked by replying packet captures in .har file format.
I plan to implement .pcap files in the future if i find those necessary, 
and possibly also scripts to craft responses. 

Databases are not yet mocked at all.


To generate a .har file inf Firefox, open the network console (Ctrl + Shift + E) and start browsing.
When done, right click on ths capture window and "Save All As HAR".

## Examples
